    Hi, I'm Guido Rota, a software engineer by training and passion.

    And this is Core 567, the site where I publish my thoughts and rants about technology, hobbies, and life.

    I've been working with software for more than 20 years, and playing with it for even longer. I am also passionate about music, photography, and languages.
