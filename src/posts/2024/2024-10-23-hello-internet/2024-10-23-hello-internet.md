It took a long time but it's finally done. Core 567 is up.

I've always wanted to start a blog, and back in 2018 I went as far as registering a domain just for this purpose, but between one thing and the other I ended up not doing anything with it for over 4 years.

Fast forward to October 2024: For various reasons I have some free time in my hands, and I decide to invest it in learning how to develop a game in Unreal Engine. As I go along in my learning journey, I start thinking _"wouldn't it be nice to document some of my learnings, for the benefit of future me and for others?"_. And so I start writing some posts on [X](https://x.com/guidorota) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1g3bciv/a_review_of_unreal_engine_5_c_the_ultimate_game/).

Then I start thinking _"it would be even better if I were able to publish longer-form articles in my own site"_. And after a few days of work, this website sees the cold light of ~~an AWS closet~~ the Internet. Not on the original domain I bought in 2018 though, that would have not been fun enough. For various reasons (and probably because I have too much discretionary time available), I decided registered a new one. The name is quasi-random, maybe one day I'll write about its meaning.

Anyway, here we are, the website is up and hopefully I will be able to start writing semi-regularly in it. There's still plenty of style changes that I want to do, but for the time being this is good enough to get started. Perfect is the enemy of good, and shipping an "ok" first step is better than never releasing anything in the wild.

So what to expect next? Realistically speaking the first few posts are going to be about how this website was built. It's nothing fancy, but there's a few aspects of this setup that I think are worth sharing with others. After that, I'll switch over to publishing about my learnings in Unreal Engine.

See you soon!
